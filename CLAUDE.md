This is a client-side web app that uses local storage to store your journal entries. Each journal entry is a response to the question "How am I experiencing this moment of being alive?". Thus, this response pertains to what is (affectively) that very moment only.

The main UI shows a 'timline' of these entries in the best visual way possible.

Each entry has:

- Description: describing the 'how' in the question
- Mood: Bad, Good, Excellent

At the top is an input box where you can enter your journal entryâ€”by typing it out and hitting 'enter'. A dropdown menu allows you to select the mood of your entry (default mood = Good).
